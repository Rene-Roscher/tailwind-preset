### Installation

> **Warning**: Installing presets will affect your existing views and assets. Presets should be installed on a fresh installation of Laravel.

To install, you must first add it as a composer dependency. Laravel will automatically register the service provider for you.

```
composer require zaknes/tailwind-preset
```

Next, install either the `tailwind` preset or the `tailwind-auth` preset. The `tailwind-auth` preset includes authentication views, routes, and a controller.

```
php artisan preset tailwind

// or

php artisan preset tailwind-auth
```

Install the NPM packages using your favorite package manager.

```
yarn install
```

Now just compile the assets using any of the Laravel build scripts (dev, prod, watch).

```
yarn run dev
```

Make sure your database is configured and migrated, and you're done!
